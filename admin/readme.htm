The Terminal Services Advanced Client is an interim release of Terminal Services components and features. The purpose of this release is to extend the functionality of Terminal Services, client side, so that system administrators, Web page designers, and Web administrators can implement Terminal Services client sessions in Web pages or Visual Basic&reg; applications without requiring the user to download or install the full Terminal Services client program. These innovations greatly extend the usefulness of Terminal Services for remote administration of servers, for Web applications, and for management of Terminal server installations.  </p><p align="right"><a href="#TOP">Back to Top</a><br><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p><p><a name="1.2"><b>1.2 Overview of Terminal Services Advanced Client Components and Features</b></a></p><p>The TSAC consists of three components.
