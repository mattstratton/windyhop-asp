This three volume series is just the thing for beginning dancers, and it comes with a practice CD...</I><P>The first video by Chris and Julee was a huge success and became the best selling beginning swing video on Amazon.com last year, and now they've just finished Volumes II and III. <P>The series is far from a basement production, in fact the videos are in broadcast quality and stereo sound. They were shot on location in our beloved Blue Door Studio (Volumes II and III) what used to be Olive (Volume I). Chris and Julee bring their same love of Lindy, talents for teaching and sense of humor to their videos that they are known for in their classes. They have taken this project very seriously, but they have never been known to take themselves too seriously - check out the hilarious blooper sections at the end of each tape.<P><A href="http://www.bigcityswing.com/video1.shtml" target=_blank>Volume I, "An Introduction to 6-Count Swing"</A>, really goes over the fundamentals of lead, follow and connection and then takes you through the basic turns of 6-Count Swing, including cross-hand turns, skaters and kick ups. <P><A href="http://www.bigcityswing.com/video2.shtml" target=_blank>Volume II, "Intermediate 6-Count Swing"</A>, begins with an insightful review of the fundamentals and introduces the triple steps and the twist for follows. The tape then goes over more advanced ways of moving between open and closed positions and more advanced turns in open position, all with an emphasis on frame, connection and smooth transitions. <P><A href="http://www.bigcityswing.com/video3.shtml" target=_blank>Volume III, "Beginning Lindy Hop"</A>, introduces the swing out from open and closed position as well as the circle. Chris and Julee then talk about mixing 6 and 8 count patterns into your dancing. <P>To top it off, they have produced a practice CD, <A href="http://www.bigcityswing.com/cd1.shtml" target=_blank>"Ready to Lindy"</A> which is perfect for the beginner. There are 6 original tunes from Tuey Connell, arranged from 96- 140 bpm. The tempos are just right to practice and perfect triple steps and the swing out. <P>Although all the tapes are on Amazon.com, you can order them directly from <A href="http://www.bigcityswing.com" target=_blank>www.bigcityswing.com</A>. This is great series             for beginning students, for gifts for friends or relatives, or for             those students who are looking to become teachers. The instruction             is clear and concise. Julee and Chris have done Chicago proud! <font class=endnews> -W-</font><!-- <table>	<tr>		<td>--></P></font>												</td>					</tr>					<tr>						<td>														<table class=block width="100%">							<tr><td class=text colspan=3><center><b>What would you like to do?</b></center></td></tr>							<tr><td class=more_link align=middle>							<A href="newsarchive.asp" >Go to News Archive</a></td><td align=middle><A class=more_link href="submitnewsstory.asp" >Submit a news story!</a>							</td><td align=middle><A class=more_link href="newsidea.asp" >Got an idea for a news story?</a></td></tr></table>						</td>					</tr>				</table>				<br>	<tr>		<td class=column1>&nbsp;</td><td colspan=2><hr>Copyright 2000, Windyhop. <A href="mailto:admin@windyhop.org" >admin@windyhop.org</A></td></tr><!-- close the column table --></table></body></html>
