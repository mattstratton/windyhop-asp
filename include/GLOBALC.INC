Data_source can be an SQL statement, a table name, or the name of a stored procedure, '  Command Object name. '? ActiveConnection_Object specifies which Connection Object to use. '? CursorType specifies the type of cursor (Forward-Only, Dynamic, Static, etc.)'  used to navigate through the RecordSet. Default is Forward-only. '? LockType specifies the type of locking (Read-Only, Pessimistic, Optimistic, etc.) '  to use on the records of the RecordSet. Default is Read-only. '? Options is an optional argument. It specifies the type of the command used in '  data_source (e.g. an SQL statement or a table name or a stored procedure, etc.) ' CursorTypeEnum Values' ===================== const AdOpenForwardOnly = 0'  ?does not allow you to view additions, modifications, or deletions of records '  made by other users and only allows scrolling-forward through the RecordSet ' (Default and usually most efficient).Note that this type of cursor does '  not allow the RecordSet to be updated.' const AdOpenKeyset = 1'  allows you to view records modified or deleted by other users after '  the RecordSet has been created.
