Windyhop's mission is to provide timely, concise, and accurate information on the Chicagoland swing dance scene as well as provide online educational/entertaining resources for the community.  As Windyhop, we aim to work as partners with the dance community to foster the Chicagoland Lindy Hop/Swing scene.<a name = 2></a><p class = "question">Why did all these groups come together to make this site?</p>The thing that ties together all of us who worked on creating Windyhopis that we were all working with various non-commercial groups to provide some kind of service to the Chicagoland swing community.  The problem is that quite frequently, we found ourselves in a position of needing to spend our own money in order to provide this service.  All of us involved realized what a great idea it would be to bring together all of the information andstrengths that each of our groups had individually and create a new unified website?.a "one-stop shop for Chicagoland Lindy Hop/Swing" if you will.  By doing so, we realized that this would benefit all involved by pooling our resourcesand cutting the costs being paid by each of these groups/individuals. <a name = 3></a><p class = "question">What happened to the old SwingHomeChicago.com site?</p>The old SwingHomeChicago site has been retired.  Everything contained in that site has been migrated over to Windyhop.  It's all still there, it just may look a little bit different.  For those of you with bookmarks to www.swinghomechicago.com,this will redirect you to www.windyhop.org.  However, we would suggest that you reset your bookmark to the new Windyhop URL.<a name = 4></a><p class = "question">How does this affect the non-partisanship of Swing Home Chicago now that they're working with CSDS?</p>This is one of the main concerns we faced when Windyhop was created.   Even though our groups are working together as one, that does not mean a bias will form against other groups.  CSDS is providing the server and web connection (which allows Windyhop to have it's glorious web presence) as a service to the Chicago swing community.  That is why CSDS has its own tab on Windyhop.  In the eyes of the Windyhop organization, all instructor groups are equal, and none will get special or preferential treatment.  Windyhop is here to help theentire community, not just some. <p class = "question"><a name = 5>Why is the URL "windyhop.org" and not "windyhop.com"?</a></p>This also took much discussion in the planning phases of Windyhop.  Everyone agreed that "dot com" sounded better, but that would not accurately reflect what Windyhop is.  Windyhop is not a company; it is an organization.  We are a non-profit group, so the "dot com" extension would not really be applicable to us.  <!--<a name = 6></a><p class = "question">What does it mean to "own" a record?</p>A) An owner can edit information for that record (i.e., phone number, email address, driving directions, etc)<p>B) An owner can submit events to the calendar which will be automatically approved. Any records related to your record can be edited by the owner, even if created by another user.<a name = 7></a><p class = "question">How do I become an owner?</p>There are two ways to become an owner. If a record already exists for your business or band (possibly created by a SwingHomeChicago.com admin), you can request ownership by clicking here or sending an email to admin@swinghomechicago.com.<p>Otherwise, you can create a new record. Ownership will be approved after a brief background check. (We're kidding - we'll just give you a call to make sure you're the appropriate party. And we will spare you any "inappropriate party" jokes here.)<a name = 8></a><p class = "question">How can I change ownership?</p>The current owner, or the person wishing to take over ownership should send an email to admin@swinghomechicago.com. Both parties will be contacted regarding this request.<a name = 9></a><p class = "question">Can non-owners post events?</p>Yes, any registered user can submit events. However, the event will not be added to the calendar until it has been reviewed by an administrator.<a name = 10></a>--><p class = "question">Why do I have to give you my phone number/email address?</p>This information is required in the event that we need to confirm your identity (for ownership of bands/venues/instructors). A valid email address is required for you to receive your initial password.<p>Individuals requesting ownership of a band/venue/instructor will be contacted via phone to confirm identity. Other than that, we will not be using your phone number for any reason (so don't worry, Punches won't be calling you up asking for a date).<p>All user information is kept in a secure database, and is not viewable by anyone other than Windyhop administrators. Please see the Windyhop <a href = "priv.asp">privacy statement</a> for more information.<a name = 11></a><p class = "question">What about privacy?</p><b>All</b> information you provide to register will be kept confidential. All of your profile information will not be seen by ANYONE except for Windyhop administrators. Windyhop does not provide any user information to advertisers, the government, or anyone else who asks us (even if they offer us nifty bribes).<a name = 12></a><p class = "question">Can I modify an event if I don't own it, but I do own the associated band/venue/instructor?</p>Yes.<a name = 13></a><p class = "question">I posted a new event, but it doesn't show in the calendar. Should I post it again?</p>A) If your are <b>not</b> the owner of anything related to the event, you do not need to try posting again. Events submitted by non-owners must be approved by administrators. Upon approval, your event will be displayed on the calendar. We do our best to approve events quickly, but this can take up to three days.<p>B) If you <b>are</b> the owner of something related to the event you have attempted to submit, the event <b>should</b> be posted automatically. Of course, we do not live in a perfect world (although we hear San Diego is close to it!), so errors do happen. In this case, send an email to help@swinghomechicago.com and we'll do our best to track down the problem.<br><br><br><br>Any other questions can be addressed to <a href=mailto:admin@windyhop.org>admin@windyhop.org</a><!-- #include file = "../include/bottom.txt" -->
